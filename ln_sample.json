    "description": "The Video Games Show (or VGS for short) is a weekly gaming industry news podcast hosted by Rich Bergin, Nick Kraftor and Greg the Engineer. While there are plenty of podcasts out there that deal with games themselves we take a closer look at the companies and people behind those games and what they are doing. News isn't the only thing we do though, we bring you reviews of the latest games, interviews with industry hot-shots and take special care to interact with our audience via email and our website. Rich and Kraft have over 50 years of gaming experience between them and VGS itself is over 8 years old! Tune in every Thursday when new episodes hit the net."

    "description": "What is your spiritual path like?  Some folks don't think they have one, but we all do.  Why is it that one way of going makes someone miserable while others going the same way seem so happy?\n\nReligion is like underwear: what works well for one person might be totally inappropriate for someone else.\n\nNo preaching or \"follow my way\" here, but a way to find the doors and windows that you might like to peek through in finding your own path.\n\nAll spiritual paths are welcome here, although some might not like all of that personal responsibility!"
